# Pass Rate Bar

This Anki add-on displays a bar on the main window/deck browser that shows the pass rate of review cards over the last 7 days.
The number of days can be changed in the config file.

This add-on is based on fonol's [anki-retention-bar](https://github.com/fonol/anki-retention-bar) add-on. All credit goes to fonol for the original source code.

I've made the following changes to the add-on:
- Fixed how the bar is added to the main window/deck browser so it doesn't conflict/break other add-ons such as [review-heatmap](https://github.com/glutanimate/review-heatmap).
- Cleaned up/fixed the HTML/CSS for the bar.
- Removed the option to show the secondary bar that shows pass rate over the last year.
